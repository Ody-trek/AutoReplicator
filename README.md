# AutoReplicator

AutoReplicator is a Python simulation of self-replicating cells based on the concept of von Neumann's self-replicating machines. The project models a grid of cells that follow simple rules to replicate and evolve over time, mimicking basic life-like behavior similar to Conway's Game of Life.

## Features
- Random initialization of cells
- Simulates cell reproduction based on neighboring states
- Step-by-step visual updates of the grid
- Customizable grid size and simulation steps

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
